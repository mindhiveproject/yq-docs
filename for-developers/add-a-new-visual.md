# Add a new visual

The basics of adding a new visual are already covered in the [quick start guide](../quick-start.md) under [code-editing](../quick-start.md#code-editing). This section will dive into the specifics of how visuals work on the backend and other advanced features.&#x20;

### Uploading files when creating visuals

When creating a new visual, users have the option to upload a file. You may upload a `.js` or .`txt` file that was directly downloaded from [P5.js](https://p5js.org) or created using the You: Quantified web app.

### Having a featured visual

To have a visual published under the main page, it must be approved by an admin of the platform. Feel free to reach out to us in case you have something interesting.

### Other types of visuals

Due to the way in which the platform handles visuals (as a code sandbox), it's technically possible to embed any type of JavaScript or React content in that iframe. Feel free to reach out to us if you have an interesting creation, such as a WebGL videogame.
